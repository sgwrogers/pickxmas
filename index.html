            <p>Chantal, my beautiful best friend. A soul that is irreplaceable for so many. The list of things that I love about you is endless but here are just a few.... your incredible heart and everything you do because of it. The love you give in boundless amounts. The laughter and joy you bring to my life. Strength that I can only admire and the way you make me strong by being there. You are the person who is always there through the good and the bad. My 'person' and my one and only sloth. <br /> <br /> I love you and everything that you are, Lydia</p>

            <p>Hello lovely, Want to remind you that you are so loved. By God, by Scott, by your family, by your friends and by pretty much everyone that comes in to contact with you, like my brother and sister, who got straight away why I think you're the absolute best. There's something so warm and genuine about you and you are unique in caring for people and connecting them. Such brilliant gifts. I know that this is such a tough season, so want to encourage you to know that our hearts are heavy with you, that we care deeply and that we are praying. You are not alone in this. "May the God of hope fill you with all joy & peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit". I am so, so thankful to have you as a friend. I am sending you such big hugs and wish I was with you.</p>
            <p>Loads of love, Helen</p>

            <p>No matter how many miles separate us all, we still feel incredible blessed to know you’re there.  We think about you often and love the times when we meet up for a coffee (water) and chat at Costa’s or for a surprise birthday dinner at the Angel for Charlotte.  We’ve had some great times and created lots of wonderful memories together.  Times away as a lifegroup at the beach for the weekend and homemade curries at both our homes.  We love you for being so kind, considerate, caring and thoughtful of others… long before you think about yourself.  The way that you attract so many people from every background in life to church, from Uber drivers to tall German men cycling in the rain!  But most of all we love you for your Banoffee Pies!!!</p>
            <p>Love, James & Charlotte</p>

            <p>My beautiful friend! May you always rest in the knowledge that God chose you before you ever did anything to earn His acceptance. I'm praying for a season of tangible grace in every area of your life, and a time of fresh dreams for your future. I'll be cheering you on all the way! <p/>

            <p>Channers, you truly amazing ray of sunshine! Love you millions! Words can’t describe how much of an amazing woman you are! But in a nut shell your caring, cute, trusting, a feeder (hehe) strong, funny, faithful, compassionate and this list goes on but Scott told me to keep this short. Love the fact that you look so innocent but then come out with some rather cheeky one liners! You are truly the best woman I know and I’m so privileged to have you in my life! Despite being half way across the other side of the world at points, you have still always been the best! Don’t ever change, love you millions!</p>
